# Static code analysis

**TODO**

## Flake8

run the static analysis:
    
    $ cd <path/to/your/clone>
    $ tox -e static
    

## Quantified Code

Quantified Code offers static code analysis as a webservice that connects to your Github repository. It is an interesting new approach and can teach you a lot about the code you write. Definitely [worth a look](https://www.quantifiedcode.com/app/project/663c550f107844aa842b4ce5e02883c4).
