### Continuous integration

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is a webservice that connects to your Github account and runs your tests for you. The configuration is in [.travis.yml](https://github.com/obestwalter/mau-mau/tree/master/.travis.yml) ([YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) format).

The badge on top of this `README` shows the [build status from Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/obestwalter/mau-mau). 

This is a very simple setup. There are many more [configuration options](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/python).
