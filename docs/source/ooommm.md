**Obvious Object Oriented Mau Mau Modelling**

Switching into egghead mode, you could say that a game of Mau Mau can be modelled as a series of interactions between actors with adjustable attributes and behaviours modifying their own attributes and initiating reactions and attribute changes in other actors. If you call the actors objects and the behaviour methods you have a basic description of object oriented programming.

> Object-oriented design is, in its simplest form, based on a seemingly elementary idea. Computing systems perform certain actions on certain objects; to obtain flexible and reusable systems, it is better to base the structure of software on the objects than on the actions. 

> -- [Bertrand Meyer - Object-Oriented Software Construction](http://www.win.tue.nl/~wstomv/quotes/meyer.pdf) 

That's all very ... abstract, isn't it? Yes it is! Meyer goes on:

> Once you have said this, you have not really provided a definition, but rather posed a set of problems: What precisely is an object? How do you find and describe the objects? How should programs manipulate objects? What are the possible relations between objects? How does one explore the commonalities that may exist between various kinds of objects? How do these ideas relate to classical software engineering concerns such as correctness, ease of use, efficiency?

What does that tell us? OO is just one of many ways of thinking about the problems you are trying to solve with software. Sometimes that way of thinking matches well with the problem you are trying to solve. There are also a lot of possibly very different answers to the questions posed by Meyer and they manifest in very different approaches to the implementation of OO in different programming languages.
