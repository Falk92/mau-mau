pip install https://github.com/obestwalter/mau-mau/zipball/master

## Installation

To install the latest code directly from github:

    $ pip install https://github.com/obestwalter/mau-mau/zipball/master
    
To install a specific version just replace `master` with the version you want to install (e.g. `1.1.0`).


**NOTE:**The dot at the end of the command is **not a typo or a spot on your screen you can't wipe away**! It means: install the contents of the folder that I am currently in as an editable package.

output like:

    Obtaining file:///</path/to/your/clone>
    Installing collected packages: OOOMMM
      Running setup.py develop for OOOMMM
    Successfully installed OOOMMM
